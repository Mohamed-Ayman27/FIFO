# Verilog FIFO Implementation with 5-bit Address Bus and 8-bit Data Bus

## Description
This project presents a Verilog module for a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory structure with a 5-bit address bus and an 8-bit data bus. The FIFO is designed to store and retrieve data in a sequential manner, following the principles of a standard FIFO data structure. The module includes read and write enable signals to control data access, ensuring seamless data transfers.

## Features
- FIFO module designed in Verilog.
- Address bus: 5 bits.
- Data bus: 8 bits.
- Read Enable (RE) and Write Enable (WE) signals for data access control.
- Efficient handling of overflow and underflow conditions.
